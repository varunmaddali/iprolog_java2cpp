Length: 20 days


The prolog programs add.pl, big.pl , lambdas.pl ,mperms.pl ,perms.pl ,queens.pl ,sud4x.pl  are executed.

The outputs of these programs are noted so that they can be compared with the C++ compiler outputs so that it can be verified for the correctness.

The java program Toks.java was very messy and took lot of time to understand it.

The java programs clause.java ,obstack.java and Intstack.java were reviewed line by line and got an overall good understanding of the programs.

The java programs clause.java ,obstack.java and Intstack.java were implemented in C++ and compiled them.

The java program Toks.java has been implemented in C++ and compiled.

The team started its first iteration of testing on Clause.CPP file.
