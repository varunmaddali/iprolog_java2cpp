# Software Engineering Group - 3


The assignments for the scrum roles are:

product owner: pavan

scrum master: manoj

development team: varun, arjun 

The role assignment was fixed through out the project since the developers have more experience with C++ than the non developers and are comfortable coding it. The non developers are responsible for facilitating the scrum process, helping the developers in code reviews, creating and prioritizing backlogs, conducting scrum meetings and sprint meetings, documentation and part of testing.

The folder blacklog contains list of items to be / had been done for each sprint with priority of tasks.
Some tasks are also been added and re-prioritized after each sprint.

The folder Sprints has detailed description of each and every sprint with Sprint backlog, Sprint details, Sprint review and retrospective files for every sprint.
